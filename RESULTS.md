## The Observations are:

- The reading assignment for each day is accurately and readablely output by the `printDailySummary()` function.
- The sum of all `minutesRead` values equals 215 minutes, the total reading time over the seven days.
- "Dune" is the most read book, as indicated by its three appearances in the log; this validates the accuracy of `mostReadBook()`.
